Hello I'm thekodak. I don't know what how to code at all. I come up with great ideas but I can't implement them
because they didn't teach me coding in school.
:-(
That's not true, I'm still pretty good at HTML version one. Back in the old school days before WYSIWYG. But thats as far as my training went.
Anyway, this is some of the projects I've created with support with really low paid and underappreciated coders I've met.
The people who work on my projects are great people who pity me and are willing to help me create my vision.
I'd like to thank them for their help and you for checking out my project.
If you'd like to participate, please reach out to me. Still haven't mastered github yet but I will.
